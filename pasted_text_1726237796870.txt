The "Access denied" message appears because current_user.is_admin is evaluating to False, meaning the application doesn't recognize you as an admin. This issue can arise due to one or more of the following reasons:

The is_admin Attribute Is Missing or Not Properly Defined in Your User Model:

If the is_admin attribute isn't defined in your User model, or if it's not properly stored in the database, current_user.is_admin will always return False.
The is_admin Field Isn't Persisted in the Database:

Even if you have the is_admin attribute in your User model, if the corresponding column doesn't exist in your database (due to not running migrations or updating the schema), the value won't be stored or retrieved correctly.
No Users Have the is_admin Flag Set to True:

If the is_admin attribute is correctly defined and persisted, but no users have this flag set to True, then no one will be able to access the admin routes.
To resolve this issue, follow these steps:

Step 1: Verify and Update Your User Model
Ensure that the is_admin attribute is correctly defined in your User model and that it's properly integrated with the database.

Here's how your User model should look:

python
Copy code
# models.py

from flask_login import UserMixin
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash, check_password_hash
from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy

db = SQLAlchemy()

class User(db.Model, UserMixin):
    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    username = db.Column(db.String(64), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password_hash = db.Column(db.String(128), nullable=False)
    is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)  # Ensure this line exists

    def set_password(self, password):
        self.password_hash = generate_password_hash(password)

    def check_password(self, password):
        return check_password_hash(self.password_hash, password)
Step 2: Migrate Your Database Schema
If you added the is_admin field after the initial database creation, you need to update your database schema to include the new column.

If you're using Flask-Migrate, run the following commands:

bash
Copy code
flask db migrate -m "Add is_admin column to User model"
flask db upgrade
If you're not using Flask-Migrate, you can manually update the database. For SQLite, you might need to drop the database and recreate it if it's in development.

Step 3: Set the is_admin Flag for a User
Now, set the is_admin flag to True for your user. You can do this in several ways:

Option A: Use the Flask Shell
Start the Flask Shell:

bash
Copy code
flask shell
Update the User:

python
Copy code
from models import db, User
user = User.query.filter_by(username='your_username').first()
if user:
    user.is_admin = True
    db.session.commit()
    print(f"User {user.username} is now an admin.")
else:
    print("User not found.")
Option B: Temporarily Modify Your Code
Add a temporary route in your app.py to set the current user as an admin:

python
Copy code
@app.route('/make_admin')
@login_required
def make_admin():
    current_user.is_admin = True
    db.session.commit()
    flash('You are now an admin.')
    return redirect(url_for('index'))
Visit http://your_app_url/make_admin while logged in to set yourself as an admin. Remember to remove or secure this route after use to prevent unauthorized access.

Step 4: Test Access to the Admin Page
After setting the is_admin flag, try accessing the admin page again. It should now allow you to view the admin dashboard.

Additional Recommendations
Ensure Secure Admin Management: In a production environment, you should have a secure way to manage admin privileges, possibly through an admin interface that only existing admins can access.

Handle Edge Cases: What if no users are admins? Consider modifying your registration logic to make the first registered user an admin:

python
Copy code
# In your register route
if User.query.count() == 0:
    new_user.is_admin = True
Use Flask-Migrate for Database Changes: If you're not already using Flask-Migrate, consider integrating it to handle database migrations smoothly.

Conclusion
The "Access denied" message occurs because the application doesn't recognize any user as an admin due to the is_admin attribute not being properly set. By ensuring the attribute exists in your User model, updating the database schema, and setting the is_admin flag for the desired user, you should be able to access the admin functionalities of your application.
